# 🌟HiLoFuseNet
This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of the **Hi**gh-gamma and **Lo**w-frequency ECoG signal **Fus**ion **Net**work (**HiLoFuseNet**) proposed in the paper: 
>Sun et al., "Spectro-Temporal Fusion of High-Gamma and Low-Frequency ECoG Signals for Intracranial Finger Movement Decoding," 2025. *under review*.

which achieves SOTA decoding performance on the public BCI Competition IV and Stanford datasets, with Pearson correlation coefficients between true and predicted finger movement trajectories of 0.631 and 0.534, representing improvements of 5.0\% and 11.9\%, respectively, over the previous best methods.
